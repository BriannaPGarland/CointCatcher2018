<br/>This is the game I created for my introduction to programming final 


For the Game that I have made, you need to open the folder “Java files in SRC Folder” then open src folder and you need to download everything in the Src folder. download the images and the three classes that are in the SRC folder and then just launch the CoinCatcher code. This game was made in java and launched in eclipse IDE.
